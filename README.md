# OON_Buttons

This code creates a 4x4 grid of interactive buttons that can be activated and deactivated by users. Clicking a button toggles its state and prints information about it, including a possible link to a GraphQL schema for further functionality. This simple interface could be used for various purposes, such as selecting options, activating features, or controlling connected systems.

# GraphQL

It offers the advantage of allowing data requests, which helps reduce network traffic and enhance performance. Being open source it has gained popularity among developers for building intricate web applications. In comparison, to REST GraphQL takes a more data approach. Enables fetching all necessary data in a single request.
